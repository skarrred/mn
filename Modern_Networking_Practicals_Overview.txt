Modern Networking Practical Concepts Overview
=============================================

1. Configure IP SLA Tracking and Path Control Topology
------------------------------------------------------
- IP SLA: Internet Protocol Service Level Agreement
- What is it? A Cisco feature used to measure network performance like delay, jitter, and availability.
- Why is it used? To monitor network paths and automatically switch to a backup path if the main one fails or becomes slow.
- How it works: A router sends probes to test connectivity. If the test fails, the router triggers a change (like a static route switch or policy-based route).

2. Using the AS_PATH Attribute
------------------------------
- AS: Autonomous System
- AS_PATH: A Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) attribute that lists all the ASes a route has passed through.
- Why is it used? To influence route selection and avoid routing loops. The shorter the AS_PATH, the more preferred the route.
- How it works: Routers compare AS_PATH lengths. You can manually set path preferences using route maps or prepend AS numbers to influence decisions.

3. Configuring IBGP and EBGP Sessions, Local Preference, and MED
----------------------------------------------------------------
- BGP: Border Gateway Protocol
- IBGP: Internal BGP (within the same Autonomous System)
- EBGP: External BGP (between different Autonomous Systems)
- Local Preference: Used to choose the preferred exit path within an AS.
- MED: Multi-Exit Discriminator - tells outside AS which link is better to reach a destination.
- Why is it used? For advanced control over route selection and traffic flow between networks.

4. Secure the Management Plane
------------------------------
- What is the Management Plane? It handles management tasks like SSH (Secure Shell), SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), and console access.
- Why is it important? If attackers gain access, they can control or monitor your device.
- How it's secured: Use strong passwords, enable SSH over Telnet, limit access using ACLs (Access Control Lists), configure login banners, and role-based access.

5. Configure and Verify Path Control Using PBR
----------------------------------------------
- PBR: Policy-Based Routing
- What is it? A technique that lets you control routing decisions based on policies, not just destination IP.
- Why is it used? To route different traffic types on different paths â€” useful for QoS (Quality of Service), backup links, etc.
- How it works: Define route-maps and access-lists to match traffic and set next-hop addresses manually.

6. IP SLA + Remote SPAN in a Campus Environment
-----------------------------------------------
- SPAN: Switched Port Analyzer
- What is Remote SPAN? A method to mirror traffic from one port/VLAN to another for remote monitoring.
- Why is it used with IP SLA? To monitor both path quality and traffic in the network.
- How it works: Configure IP SLA for network testing and Remote SPAN to send mirrored traffic to a central monitoring device.

7. Inter-VLAN Routing
---------------------
- VLAN: Virtual Local Area Network
- What is it? A way to divide a physical network into logical segments.
- Why is it used? To separate traffic (e.g., staff and students) on the same switch for better security and performance.
- What is Inter-VLAN Routing? Allows communication between devices in different VLANs.
- How it works: Usually via a router-on-a-stick setup where one router port handles traffic for multiple VLANs using sub-interfaces.

8. Simulating OpenFlow Using Mininet
------------------------------------
- OpenFlow: A protocol in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for controller-based traffic forwarding.
- SDN: Software-Defined Networking
- Mininet: A Linux tool that simulates SDN networks using OpenFlow switches and hosts.
- Why is it used? To separate the control plane (decision-making) from the data plane (packet forwarding).
- How it works: Create a virtual network in Mininet and control it using an SDN controller like POX or Ryu, often using Python.
